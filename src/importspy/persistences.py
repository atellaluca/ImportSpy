importspy.persistences
=======================

This module defines the interfaces and implementations for handling **import contracts** â€”  
external YAML files used by ImportSpy to validate the structure and runtime expectations  
of dynamically loaded Python modules.

Currently, YAML is the only supported contract format, but the architecture is fully  
extensible via the `Parser` interface.

All file access operations are wrapped in safe error handling using `handle_persistence_error`,  
which raises human-readable exceptions when contract files are missing, corrupted, or unreadable.

class Parser(ABC):
    """
    Abstract interface for import contract parsers.

    A contract parser is responsible for loading and saving `.yml` files  
    that describe the expected structure of a Python module. This abstraction  
    allows ImportSpy to support multiple formats (e.g., YAML, JSON, TOML) in the future.

    Subclasses must implement both `save()` and `load()` methods.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    def save(self, data: dict, filepath: str):
        """
        Serializes the given import contract (as a Python dictionary) and writes it to a file.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        data : dict
            A dictionary representation of the import contract.

        filepath : str
            The path where the contract should be saved (usually with `.yml` extension).

        Loads and parses an import contract from a file into a Python dictionary.

        Parameters:
        -----------
        filepath : str
            Path to the `.yml` contract file.

class PersistenceError(Exception):

    Custom exception raised when there is a problem reading or writing import contracts.

            A human-readable error message describing the failure.

    Decorator that wraps file I/O operations in safe error handling.

    If the decorated function raises any exception (e.g., file not found, malformed YAML),
    a `PersistenceError` is raised with a descriptive message instead.

    This helps ensure that ImportSpy fails gracefully during contract handling.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    func : Callable
        The function to decorate.

    --------
    Callable
