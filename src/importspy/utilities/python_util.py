"""Python Runtime Utilities

Provides utility methods to inspect the active Python runtime environment,
such as the version number and interpreter implementation.

These utilities are useful within ImportSpy to evaluate whether the current
runtime context satisfies declared compatibility constraints in import contracts.
This includes checks for specific Python versions and interpreter families
(CPython, PyPy, IronPython, etc.).

Example:
    >>> from importspy.utilities.python_util import PythonUtil
    >>> util = PythonUtil()
    >>> util.extract_python_version()
    '3.12.0'
    >>> util.extract_python_implementation()
    'CPython'

    Used internally by ImportSpy to validate runtime-specific conditions declared
    in `.yml` import contracts. This includes checking Python version and interpreter
    type during structural introspection and contract validation.

        This method queries the runtime using `platform.python_version()` and is
        typically used to match version constraints defined in an import contract.

        Returns:
            str: The Python version string (e.g., "3.11.4").

        Common values include "CPython", "PyPy", or "IronPython". This is
        essential in contexts where the implementation affects runtime behavior
