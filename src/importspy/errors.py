=================

Centralized error messaging for ImportSpy's validation system.

The `Errors` class collects all exceptions and warning messages raised during 
ImportSpy's inspection and validation process. This includes structural mismatches, 
runtime violations, and argument inconsistencies found during contract enforcement.

By consolidating these messages into a single location:

- Developers can reuse consistent, human-readable phrasing across the codebase.
- Error strings are easier to update and internationalize.
- Each message includes placeholders (`{0}`, `{1}`, etc.) to inject context-specific
  information at runtime, making diagnostics more informative.

These messages are primarily raised when validating Python modules against their
import contracts (usually defined in `.yml` files).

Categories covered:
-------------------
- üîÅ General Warnings (e.g., recursion detection)
- üì¶ Module & Variable Validation
- üß© Function, Class & Inheritance Validation
- ‚öôÔ∏è  Runtime Context Validation (OS, architecture, version)
- üß™ Annotation and Type Constraints

Usage:
------
