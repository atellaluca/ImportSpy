importspy.errors
================

Defines standardized error message templates used across ImportSpy's
validation engine. These are grouped into three main categories:

- ELEMENT_MISSING: when an expected element is declared but not found.
- ELEMENT_MISMATCH: when an element exists but does not match the contract.
- ELEMENT_INVALID: when an element has a value not permitted by the contract.

These templates are used by Context classes and validation logic to produce
clear and consistent error messages during runtime or CLI contract validation.

class Errors:
    """
    Central repository for error messages used in ImportSpyâ€™s validation engine.

    Each validation error extends one of three base templates:
    - ELEMENT_MISSING: used when an expected item is missing entirely.
    - ELEMENT_MISMATCH: used when a found item differs from the declared value.
    - ELEMENT_INVALID: used when the value is not allowed from a predefined set.
