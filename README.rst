**Core Mechanism**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
At its heart, ImportSpy leverages a robust two-phase validation process designed to ensure compatibility and compliance in every runtime environment.

1. **Developer-Defined SpyModel**:
   - A `SpyModel` acts as a blueprint, representing the expected behaviors and structures for each deployment scenario. This model is highly customizable, allowing developers to:
     - Define rules for **processor architectures** (e.g., `x86_64`, `ARM64`).
     - Specify operating systems (`Linux`, `macOS`, `Windows`).
     - Enforce constraints for Python runtimes and versions (`3.8`, `3.10`).
     - Outline the required structure for modules, including **functions**, **classes**, **attributes**, and **variables**.

2. **Runtime SpyModel Creation**:
   - At runtime, ImportSpy dynamically generates a `SpyModel` to represent the current execution context. This is achieved using advanced techniques:
     - **Reflection**: Gathers information about the executing module, including its functions, classes, and global variables.
     - **Introspection**: Captures system-level details such as the operating system, processor architecture, Python version, and implementation.
     - **Dynamic Analysis**: Constructs a comprehensive representation of the runtime environment.

3. **Validation Process**:
   - The dynamically created runtime `SpyModel` is compared against the developer-defined model:
     - **Structural Comparison**: Ensures that all required classes, methods, and variables are present and correctly defined.
     - **Semantic Validation**: Verifies annotations, return types, and argument specifications.
     - **Environment Checks**: Confirms compliance with environment-specific configurations such as `envs` or architecture constraints.
   - When inconsistencies are detected, actionable feedback is provided through detailed error messages, guiding developers to resolve issues effectively.

---

**Data Structures and Relationships**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ImportSpy models the entire execution stack, creating a hierarchy that abstracts each component and its relationships:

- **Deployment**:
  - A high-level abstraction that encapsulates multiple runtimes. Deployments can represent different environments such as edge devices, CI/CD pipelines, or local testing setups.
  - Each deployment specifies its own constraints for **architectures**, **OS**, and **Python versions**.

- **Runtime**:
  - Defines a specific combination of architecture, OS, and Python runtimes.
  - Supports validation against both general-purpose systems and highly specialized environments.

- **System**:
  - Represents the operating system and associated environment variables.
  - Tracks available Python runtimes, enabling fine-grained validation across multiple Python installations on the same system.

- **Python**:
  - Models Python runtime details:
    - Implementation (e.g., `CPython`, `PyPy`).
    - Version (e.g., `3.9`, `3.10`).
    - Loaded modules for runtime inspection.

- **Module**:
  - Encapsulates metadata about individual Python modules, including:
    - **Filename**: Tracks the module‚Äôs location.
    - **Version**: Ensures compatibility with required versions.
    - **Variables**: Captures global variables defined in the module.
    - **Functions**: Identifies available functions, along with their arguments and annotations.
    - **Classes**: Represents classes, their attributes, methods, and inheritance relationships.

- **Class**:
  - Describes Python classes within the module:
    - **Attributes**: Tracks class-level and instance-level attributes, including their types and default values.
    - **Methods**: Encapsulates methods with their arguments, annotations, and return types.
    - **Superclasses**: Lists the class's inheritance hierarchy.

- **Function**:
  - Provides a detailed representation of functions and methods:
    - **Arguments**: Captures the names, types, and default values of parameters.
    - **Annotations**: Validates argument types and return types.

This hierarchical structure allows ImportSpy to abstract and validate an entire software stack, from deployment configurations down to individual methods within a class.

---

**Actionable Feedback through Error Messaging**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ImportSpy provides precise and actionable error messages through a centralized `Errors` class, ensuring consistency and clarity. Examples include:

- **Architecture Validation**:
  - `"Invalid architecture 'arm64'. Supported architectures are: ['x86_64', 'aarch64', 'arm64', ...]."`

- **Environment Variables**:
  - `"Missing environment variable: 'DATABASE_URL'. Ensure it is defined in the system."`
  - `"Value mismatch for environment variable 'API_KEY'. Expected 'abcdef123', found 'xyz987'."`

- **Class and Method Validation**:
  - `"Missing class: 'UserManager'. Ensure it is defined in the module 'user_module'."`
  - `"Missing method: 'save_to_db' in class 'DatabaseHandler'. Ensure it is implemented and matches the required signature."`

- **Annotations**:
  - `"Annotation mismatch for method 'process_data'. Expected return type 'List[str]', found 'str'."`
  - `"Annotation mismatch for argument 'config' in method 'initialize'. Expected type 'dict', found 'str'."`

These detailed and realistic diagnostic messages enable developers to identify and resolve issues effectively, reducing debugging time and increasing the robustness of integrations.

These are just a few examples of the comprehensive error feedback provided by ImportSpy. From validating environment configurations to enforcing structural and behavioral expectations, ImportSpy equips developers with a powerful toolset for ensuring consistency and reliability. üåü
