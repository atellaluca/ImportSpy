    class IoTPluginSpy(SpyModel):
        deployments: List[Deployment] = [
            Deployment(
                runtimes=[

                                    )
                                ]
                            )
                        ]
                    )
                ]
            )
        ]
        classes: List[Class] = [
            Class(
                name="SensorPlugin",

                ]
            )
        ]

**Compliant IoT Plugin Example**:
Here‚Äôs a compliant implementation of an IoT plugin that adheres to the defined `SpyModel`.

.. code-block:: python

    class SensorPlugin:
        plugin_name = "TemperatureSensor"

        def __init__(self):
            self.sensor_id = None

        def initialize(self):
            print("Sensor initialized.")

        def send_data(self, data: dict):
            print(f"Data sent: {data}")

**Non-Compliant IoT Plugin Example**:
This implementation is non-compliant due to missing attributes and an incorrect method signature.

.. code-block:: python

    class SensorPlugin:
        def __init__(self):
            pass  # Missing required attributes

        def send_data(self, temperature: float):
            print(f"Temperature: {temperature}")  # Incorrect method signature

**Validation and Adaptation**: When a non-compliant plugin is detected, ImportSpy provides actionable feedback, allowing developers to adapt their implementations.

**Example Feedback**:

- Missing attribute: `plugin_name` in class `SensorPlugin`.
- Method signature mismatch for `send_data`. Expected `send_data(self, data: dict)`, found `send_data(self, temperature: float)`.

**Revised Plugin**:

Here‚Äôs the corrected implementation of the plugin based on ImportSpy‚Äôs feedback.

.. code-block:: python

    class SensorPlugin:
        plugin_name = "TemperatureSensor"

        def __init__(self):
            self.sensor_id = None

        def initialize(self):
            print("Sensor initialized.")

        def send_data(self, data: dict):
            print(f"Data sent: {data}")

**Conclusion**:
ImportSpy ensures that IoT plugins are validated against the defined requirements, improving reliability and reducing integration issues.

Core Mechanism üî¨
=================

At the heart of **ImportSpy** lies a sophisticated and robust **two-phase validation process**, meticulously designed to ensure compatibility, reliability, and compliance across diverse runtime environments. This mechanism empowers developers to maintain full control over their code‚Äôs behavior in various contexts.

Developer-Defined SpyModel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The cornerstone of ImportSpy's functionality is the `SpyModel`, a highly customizable blueprint that defines the expected behaviors and structures for each deployment scenario. This declarative model allows developers to predefine critical aspects of their runtime environment:

- **Processor Architectures**: Enforce compatibility with specific architectures such as `x86_64` or `ARM64`.
- **Operating Systems**: Support a wide range of platforms including `Linux`, `macOS`, and `Windows`.
- **Python Runtimes**: Specify compatible Python versions (`3.8`, `3.10`, etc.) and implementations (`CPython`, `PyPy`).
- **Module Structures**: Define the required structure of modules, including:

  - **Functions**: Expected names, argument specifications, and return types.
  - **Classes**: Mandatory attributes, methods, and inheritance hierarchies.
  - **Variables**: Global and local variables with precise annotations.

By defining these rules upfront, developers can shift from reactive debugging to proactive validation, minimizing integration errors and ensuring consistent behavior across environments.

Runtime SpyModel Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During execution, ImportSpy dynamically constructs a `SpyModel` representing the current runtime environment. This process leverages Python's introspective capabilities and advanced analysis techniques:

- **Reflection**: Extracts runtime details about functions, classes, variables, and their relationships within the module.
- **Introspection**: Captures key system-level properties, including:
  - Operating System and Architecture (e.g., `Linux`, `ARM64`).
  - Python implementation and version (e.g., `CPython 3.10`).
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Builds a detailed representation of the runtime state, mapping it to the predefined expectations.

Validation Process
==================

The validation process compares the dynamically generated `SpyModel` with the developer-defined model to identify discrepancies and ensure compliance. This involves three key checks:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 20 80
   :header-rows: 1

   * - **Check**
     - **Description**
   * - **Structural Comparison**
     - Validates the presence and proper structure of required classes, methods, and variables. Ensures adherence to declared hierarchies and relationships.
   * - **Semantic Validation**
     - Verifies argument specifications, return types, and type annotations. Ensures alignment with Python's type hinting for modern programming practices.
   * - **Environment Checks**
     - Confirms the runtime environment meets defined constraints, including:

       - **System Configurations**: Validates environment variables like `AUTH_TOKEN`.
       - **Compatibility**: Checks alignment with specified architecture and Python runtime.

Actionable Feedback üìã
======================

When inconsistencies are detected, ImportSpy provides clear, actionable error messages. These messages include placeholders (e.g., `{0}`, `{1}`) that dynamically adapt to the context of the runtime and the configuration defined in the `SpyModel`.
