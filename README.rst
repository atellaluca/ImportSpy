**Developer-Defined SpyModel**:
The `SpyModel` defines the required structure for IoT plugins, including runtime configurations, expected classes, attributes, and methods.

.. code-block:: python

    from importspy.models import SpyModel, Deployment, Runtime, System, Python, Class, Attribute, Function, Argument
    from importspy.constants import Config

    class IoTPluginSpy(SpyModel):
        deployments: List[Deployment] = [
            Deployment(
                runtimes=[

                                    )
                                ]
                            )
                        ]
                    )
                ]
            )
        ]
        classes: List[Class] = [
            Class(

                        arguments=[
                            Argument(name="self")
                        ]
                    ),
                    Function(

                        ]
                    )
                ]
            )
        ]

**Compliant IoT Plugin Example**:
Here‚Äôs a compliant implementation of an IoT plugin that adheres to the defined `SpyModel`.

.. code-block:: python

    class SensorPlugin:
        plugin_name = "TemperatureSensor"

        def __init__(self):
            self.sensor_id = None

        def initialize(self):
            print("Sensor initialized.")

        def send_data(self, data: dict):
            print(f"Data sent: {data}")

**Non-Compliant IoT Plugin Example**:
This implementation is non-compliant due to missing attributes and an incorrect method signature.

.. code-block:: python

    class SensorPlugin:
        def __init__(self):
            pass  # Missing required attributes

        def send_data(self, temperature: float):
            print(f"Temperature: {temperature}")  # Incorrect method signature

**Validation and Adaptation**: When a non-compliant plugin is detected, ImportSpy provides actionable feedback, allowing developers to adapt their implementations.

**Example Feedback**:

- Missing attribute: `plugin_name` in class `SensorPlugin`.
- Method signature mismatch for `send_data`. Expected `send_data(self, data: dict)`, found `send_data(self, temperature: float)`.

**Revised Plugin**:

Here‚Äôs the corrected implementation of the plugin based on ImportSpy‚Äôs feedback.

.. code-block:: python

    class SensorPlugin:
        plugin_name = "TemperatureSensor"

        def __init__(self):
            self.sensor_id = None

        def initialize(self):
            print("Sensor initialized.")

        def send_data(self, data: dict):
            print(f"Data sent: {data}")

**Conclusion**:
ImportSpy ensures that IoT plugins are validated against the defined requirements, improving reliability and reducing integration issues. By leveraging ImportSpy‚Äôs reflective capabilities, developers can confidently integrate third-party modules into IoT ecosystems, ensuring consistent performance across all supported environments.

Technical Overview üî¨
=====================

Delve into the inner workings of ImportSpy and uncover the technical foundations that make it a powerful tool for runtime validation and module compliance.

Core Mechanism üî¨
=================

At the heart of **ImportSpy** lies a sophisticated and robust **two-phase validation process**, meticulously designed to ensure compatibility, reliability, and compliance across diverse runtime environments. This mechanism empowers developers to maintain full control over their code‚Äôs behavior in various contexts.

Developer-Defined SpyModel
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The cornerstone of ImportSpy's functionality is the `SpyModel`, a highly customizable blueprint that defines the expected behaviors and structures for each deployment scenario. This declarative model allows developers to predefine critical aspects of their runtime environment:

- **Processor Architectures**: Enforce compatibility with specific architectures such as `x86_64` or `ARM64`.
- **Operating Systems**: Support a wide range of platforms including `Linux`, `macOS`, and `Windows`.
- **Python Runtimes**: Specify compatible Python versions (`3.8`, `3.10`, etc.) and implementations (`CPython`, `PyPy`).
- **Module Structures**: Define the required structure of modules, including:

  - **Functions**: Expected names, argument specifications, and return types.
  - **Classes**: Mandatory attributes, methods, and inheritance hierarchies.
  - **Variables**: Global and local variables with precise annotations.

By defining these rules upfront, developers can shift from reactive debugging to proactive validation, minimizing integration errors and ensuring consistent behavior across environments.

Runtime SpyModel Creation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During execution, ImportSpy dynamically constructs a `SpyModel` representing the current runtime environment. This process leverages Python's introspective capabilities and advanced analysis techniques:

- **Reflection**: Extracts runtime details about functions, classes, variables, and their relationships within the module.
- **Introspection**: Captures key system-level properties, including:
  - Operating System and Architecture (e.g., `Linux`, `ARM64`).
  - Python implementation and version (e.g., `CPython 3.10`).
- **Dynamic Analysis**: Builds a detailed representation of the runtime state, mapping it to the predefined expectations.

Validation Process
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The validation process is where the magic happens. The dynamically generated `SpyModel` is compared against the developer-defined model to identify discrepancies and ensure compliance. This comparison involves three core checks:

1. **Structural Comparison**:
   - Validates that required classes, methods, and variables are present and properly structured.
   - Ensures adherence to declared hierarchies and relationships.

2. **Semantic Validation**:
   - Verifies argument specifications, return types, and type annotations.
   - Checks alignment with Python‚Äôs type hinting for modern programming practices.

3. **Environment Checks**:

   - Confirms the runtime environment meets all defined constraints, including:

     - System configurations (e.g., environment variables like `AUTH_TOKEN`).
     - Compatibility with the specified architecture and Python runtime.

Actionable Feedback üìã
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When inconsistencies are detected, ImportSpy provides **clear, actionable error messages**. These messages help developers pinpoint the root cause of issues and make precise adjustments. Examples include:

- `Missing class: 'UserManager'. Ensure it is defined in the module 'user_module'.`
- `Annotation mismatch for method 'process_data'. Expected return type 'List[str]', found 'str'.`
- `Invalid architecture 'arm64'. Supported architectures are: ['x86_64', 'aarch64'].`

By combining proactive validation with actionable insights, ImportSpy equips developers with the tools they need to build resilient, adaptable, and compliant software.

Summary
~~~~~~~
The **Core Mechanism** of ImportSpy bridges the gap between flexibility and control, enabling developers to confidently deploy code across diverse environments. From defining robust validation rules to dynamically analyzing runtime environments, ImportSpy delivers a comprehensive solution for ensuring runtime integrity and modular reliability.
