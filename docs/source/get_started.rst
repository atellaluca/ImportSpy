Get Started with ImportSpy 🚀
=============================

Welcome to the official **Get Started** guide for ImportSpy!

This section is your hands-on introduction to ImportSpy’s capabilities and philosophy.  
If you're building systems with **plugins**, **microservices**, **modular designs**, or simply want **more control over how your code is imported**, you're in the right place.

ImportSpy brings structure and validation to Python's dynamic import system — allowing you to **enforce strict module contracts**, detect **runtime mismatches**, and ensure that every imported module behaves exactly as expected.

What You’ll Learn 📘
---------------------

This guide walks you through everything you need to **set up, understand, and use ImportSpy effectively**, including:

- 🧰 **Installation**  
  Learn how to install ImportSpy using your preferred package manager and verify your setup.

- 🔍 **Example Overview**  
  Explore a real-world use case built around a **plugin-based architecture**, and understand how ImportSpy adds reliability to it.

- 📜 **Import Contracts in YAML**  
  Understand how ImportSpy uses `.yml` contracts to define what an external module must look like: classes, methods, attributes, environments, and more.

- ⚙️ **Code Walkthrough**  
  Dive into a fully working example and see how ImportSpy enforces contracts dynamically at runtime.

- 🧪 **Validation in Action**  
  Run the example locally and observe how ImportSpy validates external modules and reports violations clearly and precisely.

Is This Guide for You?
-----------------------

Absolutely — if any of these apply to you:

- ✅ You’ve never used ImportSpy before and want a guided path  
- ✅ You work with Python plugins, extensions, or modular projects  
- ✅ You want to ensure that external code is predictable and secure  
- ✅ You're interested in enforcing structure and compliance at runtime  

What You’ll Need 🛠️
--------------------

- Basic familiarity with Python and importing modules  
- **Python 3.10 or later** installed on your machine  
- A terminal or shell to execute ImportSpy from the command line (optional for CLI mode)  
- A willingness to explore and experiment!

Let’s Build Your First Validated Project ✅
-------------------------------------------

In the next steps, you’ll learn how to:

1. Install ImportSpy in seconds  
2. Define your first import contract  
3. Validate an external module in both embedded and CLI mode  
4. Understand how ImportSpy reacts to structural mismatches  
5. Integrate it into a real project

By the end of this guide, you’ll have a **fully functional ImportSpy environment**, understand the power of import contracts, and feel confident applying them in your own architecture.
