Understanding ImportSpy üîç
==========================

Welcome to the **technical heart** of ImportSpy.

This section provides a full breakdown of how ImportSpy works,  
why it matters in modern modular architectures, and how you can harness its full potential.

ImportSpy isn‚Äôt just a utility ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **runtime contract enforcement framework**.  
It brings validation to the import system by ensuring that external modules conform to **predefined structural rules and runtime constraints**.  
Whether used in embedded or CLI mode, ImportSpy guarantees **predictability, security, and compliance** before code ever runs.

Why This Section Matters ‚ö†Ô∏è
----------------------------

Modern systems are complex.  
You rely on dynamically loaded modules, plugins, APIs, microservices ‚Äî often across multiple environments.

But with this flexibility comes risk:

- Missing or incompatible methods, attributes, or classes  
- Subtle mismatches in Python versions, OS, or interpreters  
- Unexpected behavior caused by configuration drift or structural divergence  
- Modules that silently break contracts and cause late-stage failures

ImportSpy intercepts these issues **before execution**, making validation **a first-class citizen** of your architecture.

Who This Is For üë®‚Äçüíªüë©‚Äçüíª
---------------------------

This section is written for:

- **Developers** using ImportSpy in plugin-based or multi-module Python apps  
- **Architects** designing extensible, contract-driven software systems  
- **DevOps and Security Engineers** aiming to validate runtime boundaries and block unknowns  
- **Open Source Maintainers** who want to ensure compatibility across environments
