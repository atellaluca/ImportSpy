Validation and Compliance in ImportSpy
=======================================

ImportSpy is more than a validator — it's a **compliance enforcement layer**  
that ensures every import happens under the right conditions.

It prevents fragile integrations, runtime surprises, and architectural drift by validating  
**both the structure of modules** and **the environment they run in** — before they’re allowed to execute.

Why Compliance Matters
-----------------------

In modern Python systems, you often deal with:

- Multiple operating systems and architectures  
- Third-party plugins and dynamic module loading  
- Varying Python runtimes across dev/staging/prod  
- Environment variables that silently shape behavior  

Without strict validation, these differences introduce risk.

ImportSpy guarantees that external modules only execute if their importing environment **matches the declared constraints** in their import contract.

Multilayer Validation
----------------------

ImportSpy checks compliance at multiple levels:

Execution Context
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before a module runs, ImportSpy validates:

- Which module is trying to import it (via introspection)  
- The **OS**, **architecture**, **Python version**, and **interpreter**  
- Any required **environment variables**  
- Whether the current runtime matches one of the allowed **deployment blocks**

If anything is off, validation fails — no execution occurs.

Example:

- ✅ Declared: CPython 3.12.8 on Linux  
  ✅ Actual: CPython 3.12.8 on Linux → Allowed  
- ❌ Declared: Windows-only  
  ❌ Actual: Linux → Rejected  
- ❌ Declared: Requires `PLUGIN_KEY`  
  ❌ Missing from environment → Blocked

Module Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Structural validation includes:

- Required **functions**, with specific argument names and annotations  
- Required **classes**, including attributes, methods, and superclasses  
- Top-level **variables** and their expected values  
- Submodule definitions (when declared inside a `deployment`)

If a module fails to meet these expectations, it's rejected at import time.

System-Level Constraints
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ImportSpy allows contracts to specify:

- Required environment variables  
- Specific OS-level deployments  
- Architecture-specific compatibility (e.g., only ARM64)

This prevents issues like:

- Silent misconfiguration  
- Undeclared system assumptions  
- Crashes due to missing runtime data

Diagnostics and Failure Behavior
--------------------------------

ImportSpy is strict: when validation fails, execution halts.

But it also provides **high-quality error feedback**, including:

- ❌ What went wrong (e.g., `"Missing method 'run'"`)  
- ❌ Where the mismatch occurred (e.g., `"In class Extension"`)  
- ❌ Why it’s invalid (e.g., `"Expected str, found int"`)

Errors are raised as `ValueError` with clear stack traces and contract violation summaries.

This fail-fast approach prevents issues from reaching production — or worse, going unnoticed.

Maintaining Long-Term Compliance
---------------------------------

ImportSpy helps teams enforce long-term consistency via:

- **Versioned contracts** that evolve with your code  
- **Validation in CI/CD pipelines** to catch regressions early  
- **Runtime checks** in production or sandbox environments

This ensures:

- No configuration drift  
- No mismatches between staging and production  
- Structural integrity across deployments and updates

Compliance Is Not Optional
---------------------------

ImportSpy adopts a **Zero-Trust philosophy**:

> ❌ No module is trusted without validation  
> ✅ No import occurs unless the environment is approved

This guarantees:

- Secure plugin systems  
- Stable microservice communication  
- Predictable behavior across machines and versions

If you care about runtime integrity, ImportSpy turns your import logic into **an enforceable contract** — and blocks anything that breaks it.
