Validation and Compliance in ImportSpy
======================================

Ensuring that external modules are **imported in a valid execution environment**  
is fundamental to maintaining software **stability and security**.

ImportSpy introduces a **robust validation mechanism** that systematically verifies  
whether the **importing environment** meets the constraints imposed by the module  
being imported. This prevents **uncontrolled modifications, runtime inconsistencies,  
and unexpected failures**.

By enforcing **compliance at multiple levels**, ImportSpy guarantees that modules  
operate within a **predictable, structured, and controlled execution context**.

Understanding Execution Context Validation
------------------------------------------

Validation in ImportSpy begins by analyzing **the environment in which a module is being imported**.  
Rather than inspecting the module itself, ImportSpy **traces the source of the import**,  
verifying that the importing module and its execution context **comply with the rules  
declared in the import contract (SpyModel)**.

Python’s **dynamic nature** allows execution across **different OS environments, Python versions,  
and system configurations**, which can introduce **significant risks**  
when dependencies evolve **unpredictably**.

ImportSpy **mitigates these risks** by ensuring that the execution environment is **fully compliant**  
with the predefined **constraints set by the contract**.

If an environment **fails to meet these constraints**, ImportSpy **prevents execution**,  
ensuring that the module is only used in **controlled, verified conditions**.

Runtime Environment Compliance
------------------------------

Beyond **execution context validation**, ImportSpy enforces **compliance with runtime constraints**, such as:

- **Python version** and interpreter (e.g. CPython, PyPy)
- **Operating system** (e.g. Linux, Windows, macOS)
- **Hardware architecture** (e.g. x86_64, ARM64)

Examples:

- If a contract declares compatibility **only with Python 3.9**, but the import occurs in **Python 3.7**,  
  validation **fails** and execution is blocked.

- If the contract restricts execution to **Linux**, but the code runs on **Windows**,  
  ImportSpy halts the import.

- If the interpreter does not match (e.g., PyPy is used instead of CPython),  
  ImportSpy prevents execution.

By enforcing these rules, ImportSpy ensures **modules only run in supported environments**,  
preventing compatibility errors and undefined behavior.

Enforcing System-Level Constraints
----------------------------------

Many Python modules depend on:

- **Environment variables** (e.g., credentials, flags, endpoints)
- **External system configurations**
- **Architecture-specific optimizations**

ImportSpy allows import contracts to declare these constraints explicitly. For example:

- If a module requires the environment variable `API_KEY`, ImportSpy verifies its presence before proceeding.
- If a module targets **ARM architecture only**, ImportSpy blocks execution on incompatible systems.

This level of enforcement prevents:

- **Silent misconfiguration**
- **Missing dependencies**
- **Runtime crashes**

and ensures that all **system-level expectations are fulfilled** at import time.

Handling Compliance Failures
----------------------------

When validation fails, ImportSpy raises **structured errors** that explain:

- What failed
- Why it failed
- Where the violation occurred

For example:

- `"Missing required environment variable: API_KEY"`
- `"Unsupported OS: Expected Linux, found Windows"`
- `"Function 'process' has mismatched argument signature"`

ImportSpy distinguishes between:

- **Critical violations** (e.g., missing components) → execution is blocked
- **Minor inconsistencies** → warnings may be raised (depending on enforcement mode)

This allows teams to adopt a **Zero-Trust stance**, while still providing **actionable diagnostics**.

Maintaining Long-Term Compliance
--------------------------------

ImportSpy enables **ongoing compliance validation** through:

- **Versioned import contracts**, updated as modules evolve
- **Automated enforcement in CI/CD pipelines**
- **Runtime validation in production or sandboxed environments**

This ensures consistency across:

- Development
- Testing
- Deployment

and reduces the risks of:

- Configuration drift
- Hidden regressions
- Undocumented structural changes

Final Considerations
--------------------

Validation and compliance are **not optional** in modern Python software.  
They are essential to maintaining:

- Predictability
- Stability
- Security

ImportSpy provides a complete framework to:

- **Enforce strict contracts**
- **Detect mismatches early**
- **Prevent fragile imports**

Whether you're writing a plugin, managing a deployment pipeline, or hardening production code,  
ImportSpy ensures that every import **happens under the right conditions**—no more, no less.
