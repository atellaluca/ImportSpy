Spy Execution Flow
==================

ImportSpy operates as a validation layer that ensures external modules comply with a well-defined structural  
and runtime model before they interact with the core framework. The validation process follows a structured  
execution flow that dynamically reconstructs and evaluates the imported module, verifying its consistency  
with predefined expectations. This approach prevents uncontrolled modifications, enforces compliance,  
and ensures that software maintains predictable behavior across different environments.

Identifying the Import Context
------------------------------

The execution flow begins with identifying the context in which an external module is being imported.  
Unlike traditional validation systems that examine only the imported module itself, ImportSpy traces the source  
of the import to determine which external component is introducing the dependency. This process ensures that validation  
is applied precisely where the interaction occurs, preventing unauthorized modules from bypassing structural checks.

Using reflection mechanisms, ImportSpy inspects the execution stack to determine which module initiated the import process.  
This information is critical in establishing a validation boundary, as it allows ImportSpy to distinguish between core components  
and external dependencies. By defining the scope of validation at the moment of import, ImportSpy ensures that compliance checks  
are only enforced on relevant modules while preserving the integrity of the framework’s internal components.

Extracting the Module Structure
-------------------------------

Once the import context is established, ImportSpy proceeds with analyzing the module’s structure.  
This process involves extracting all relevant elements, including function definitions, class hierarchies,  
global variables, and metadata associated with the module. Unlike static validation methods, ImportSpy performs  
this analysis dynamically, reconstructing a representation of the module as it exists at runtime.  

This runtime analysis allows ImportSpy to capture both explicit and implicit dependencies within the module.  
For example, in cases where the module dynamically defines attributes or classes based on execution conditions,  
ImportSpy ensures that these elements are recognized and validated accordingly. This prevents discrepancies between  
expected and actual module structures, reducing the risk of runtime errors due to unforeseen modifications.

Building the SpyModel Representation
-------------------------------------

After extracting the module’s structure, ImportSpy constructs a corresponding SpyModel representation.  
This dynamically generated model serves as a reference for comparison, encapsulating all relevant aspects  
of the module’s expected behavior. The SpyModel is designed to be comprehensive, capturing details  
such as function signatures, inheritance structures, variable assignments, and execution constraints.

Unlike a static configuration file, the SpyModel adapts to different execution environments,  
ensuring that validation rules remain relevant across multiple deployment scenarios.  
This adaptability allows ImportSpy to enforce compliance in heterogeneous environments  
where variations in Python versions, operating systems, and hardware architectures  
could otherwise introduce inconsistencies. The SpyModel is not a simple contract;  
it is a **runtime-enforced specification** that ensures modules conform to predefined structures  
while allowing for controlled flexibility when required.

Comparing the Module with the Expected Structure
------------------------------------------------

With the SpyModel constructed, ImportSpy performs a validation check by comparing the dynamically generated  
module representation against the expected model. This comparison includes a structural analysis of functions,  
classes, and attributes, ensuring that all expected components are present and correctly defined.  
If any deviations are detected, ImportSpy logs the discrepancies and prevents execution  
if critical compliance violations are found.

The validation process does not merely check for missing elements; it also enforces consistency in function signatures,  
return types, class inheritance relationships, and global variable states. If an external module modifies an attribute,  
introduces an unexpected change in function parameters, or alters the expected behavior of a class,  
ImportSpy flags the inconsistency and raises an exception. This strict enforcement mechanism prevents  
silent failures by ensuring that all modifications are explicitly accounted for within the validation model.

Handling Compliance Failures
----------------------------

When a module fails validation, ImportSpy provides detailed feedback on the nature of the discrepancy.  
Rather than issuing generic error messages, ImportSpy generates structured reports that indicate  
which elements are non-compliant, what modifications led to the failure,  
and how the detected issues deviate from the expected model. These reports  
help developers quickly identify and resolve inconsistencies, reducing debugging time  
and ensuring that external dependencies remain predictable and stable.

In cases where minor deviations are detected but do not critically impact execution,  
ImportSpy can be configured to issue warnings instead of blocking execution.  
This flexibility allows development teams to assess non-critical modifications  
while still enforcing strict compliance on essential module elements.  
The ability to differentiate between major and minor violations ensures  
that ImportSpy remains an adaptable validation tool without unnecessarily obstructing development workflows.

Approving and Executing Validated Modules
-----------------------------------------

If a module passes validation, ImportSpy allows it to proceed with execution.  
At this stage, the module is treated as compliant, meaning that it meets  
all predefined structural and runtime expectations. This validation approval  
ensures that only authorized and properly structured modules interact with  
the core framework, preventing unexpected behavior due to uncontrolled dependencies.

Once a module is validated, its structure is cached to optimize performance  
in subsequent imports. By leveraging a validation cache, ImportSpy minimizes  
overhead in environments where the same modules are repeatedly loaded,  
ensuring that compliance checks do not introduce unnecessary execution delays.  
This optimization maintains the efficiency of module validation  
while preserving the integrity of structural enforcement.

Ensuring Long-Term Consistency
------------------------------

Beyond immediate validation at the point of import, ImportSpy enables long-term consistency  
by enforcing compliance across multiple software versions and deployment environments.  
By maintaining a standardized validation process, ImportSpy ensures that module integrity  
remains intact even as dependencies evolve over time. This approach reduces the likelihood  
of compatibility issues, ensuring that applications remain stable and reliable  
as external modules undergo updates and modifications.

By integrating ImportSpy into the software development lifecycle, teams can establish  
a systematic approach to dependency validation, reducing the risks associated  
with uncontrolled changes in third-party libraries. ImportSpy acts as a safeguard  
against unexpected modifications, ensuring that all imported modules  
adhere to clearly defined structural and runtime constraints.  
This validation framework enhances software predictability, mitigates runtime failures,  
and ensures that applications operate in a controlled and secure manner.
