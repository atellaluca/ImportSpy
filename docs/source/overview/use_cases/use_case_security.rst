Enhancing Security by Enforcing Controlled Framework Interactions
=================================================================

Security vulnerabilities can emerge when external modules interact with a core framework without clear compliance rules.  
Uncontrolled dependencies can introduce security risks, leading to unintended data exposure or bypassed security controls.  

With **ImportSpy**, you can:  

- ‚úÖ Define security policies for external module interactions through the **SpyModel**  
- ‚úÖ Ensure that only approved modules interact with your core framework  
- ‚úÖ Prevent unauthorized or risky interactions that could compromise security  

**Hypothetical scenario:**  
A cybersecurity company discovered that some external modules were accessing security-critical functions of their core framework in unintended ways.  
By implementing **ImportSpy**, they enforced strict compliance rules, ensuring that only vetted modules could interact with sensitive parts of their system, reducing security risks.
