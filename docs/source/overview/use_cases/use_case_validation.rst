Ensuring Import Validation in Large-Scale Projects
===================================================

Managing dependencies in large-scale software projects can be challenging.  
When external modules interact with a core framework, ensuring that these interactions follow defined rules is crucial to maintaining stability and consistency.  

With **ImportSpy**, you can:  

- ‚úÖ Define explicit rules for how external modules interact with your core framework  
- ‚úÖ Ensure compliance with project standards through the **SpyModel**  
- ‚úÖ Prevent unexpected or unauthorized module interactions that could introduce inconsistencies  

**Hypothetical scenario:**  
A fintech company developing a microservices-based architecture faced issues with unintended module interactions affecting critical business logic.  
By implementing **ImportSpy** and defining clear compliance rules through the **SpyModel**, they ensured that only approved modules could interact with their core framework, reducing unexpected behavior and improving maintainability.
