ImportSpy Architecture
======================

**Welcome to the ImportSpy Architecture Guide!**  
This section provides a **deep dive** into the **design, structure, and core mechanisms** that power ImportSpy.  
Whether you're an **advanced user, Python developer, security engineer, or contributor**, this guide will help you  
understand the **rationale, decisions, and execution pipeline** behind ImportSpy’s dynamic validation system.

Why ImportSpy’s Architecture Matters 🤔
---------------------------------------

ImportSpy is more than just a validation utility—it is a **runtime compliance enforcement engine**.  
Its architecture is designed to ensure that **imported modules are only executed in controlled environments**,  
through a combination of **dynamic analysis**, **declarative contracts**, and **execution interception**.

Without a structured validation layer like ImportSpy, modern software faces:

- ❌ **API Fragility** – Undeclared changes in external module interfaces cause silent failures.  
- ❌ **Environmental Inconsistencies** – Applications behave differently across dev/stage/prod setups.  
- ❌ **Security Gaps** – Imports of unverified modules expose critical systems to unauthorized code.  

ImportSpy’s architecture eliminates these risks by enforcing **predictable, contract-driven validation**  
at every import boundary.
