ImportSpy Architecture
======================

The Internal Blueprint of Runtime Validation 🧠
-----------------------------------------------

ImportSpy is more than a module linter — it is an **import-time enforcement layer**  
that introduces structural awareness and compliance validation directly into the Python runtime.

This section explores **how ImportSpy works under the hood**, breaking down its core architecture  
into modular layers that combine **dynamic reflection**, **declarative contracts**, and **runtime interception**.

Why Architecture Matters
-------------------------

In a Python ecosystem where:

- Modules are shared across microservices and containers,
- Plugins are authored by third parties,
- Deployments span heterogeneous systems,

...you need more than just "tests". You need a **validation engine** that adapts at runtime.

ImportSpy was designed to:

- 🛡️ **Enforce predictable structure** in external modules  
- 🧩 **Capture and interpret runtime conditions** dynamically  
- 🔒 **Prevent misaligned or unauthorized integrations**  

It introduces formal boundaries where Python has none.

What You'll Learn in This Section 📚
------------------------------------

This section explains how ImportSpy brings **declarative rigor to dynamic Python environments**.

You’ll explore:

- ✅ The **layered architecture** that enables flexible yet strict validation  
- ✅ The **rationale behind each design decision** — from using YAML contracts to stack inspection  
- ✅ The **engine that drives compliance enforcement**, based on Pydantic and reflection  
- ✅ The **runtime analyzer** that reconstructs execution environments  
- ✅ The **performance patterns** that make ImportSpy usable even at scale
