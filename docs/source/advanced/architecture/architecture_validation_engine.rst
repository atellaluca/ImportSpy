The Validation Engine: Import-Time Assurance for Python
=======================================================

At the center of ImportSpy lies its **validation engine** — a layered, runtime-first mechanism designed to make sure that:

✅ Code only runs in verified environments  
✅ Structure and behavior match declared expectations  
✅ Unauthorized imports are blocked at the boundary

Unlike static linters or test suites, ImportSpy runs at **import time**, ensuring that modules are **never executed unless compliant** — a zero-trust posture for the Python ecosystem.

🎯 What the Validation Engine Actually Does
-------------------------------------------

The validation engine intercepts import events and answers:

- Is the importing environment trusted?
- Is the runtime (OS, architecture, interpreter) allowed?
- Does the structure of the module match what was promised?
- Are declared environment variables, dependencies, and APIs present?

It acts like a **runtime compliance firewall** — catching issues before a single line of code is executed.

📦 Core Pipeline Stages
------------------------

Whether in **embedded** mode, ImportSpy uses the same five-stage validation pipeline:

1️⃣ **Import Interception**  
   - Uses stack inspection (`inspect.stack`) to trace the importing module.  
   - Determines the precise origin of the import.

2️⃣ **Context Modeling (SpyModel Construction)**  
   - Builds a full runtime profile:  
     - OS, CPU architecture  
     - Python version and interpreter  
     - Environment variables  
     - Nested module dependencies

3️⃣ **Structural Validation**  
   - Analyzes the module’s actual structure (via `inspect`, `ast`, `getmembers`)  
   - Compares it against the declared contract:
     - Classes and superclasses  
     - Function names, signatures, return types  
     - Global variables, attributes, and annotations

4️⃣ **Contract Evaluation**  
   - Evaluates the runtime `SpyModel` against the declared import contract (in YAML or Python).  
   - Uses typed validators to match expected values — with support for optional vs required fields.

5️⃣ **Enforcement & Feedback**  
   - ✅ If all checks pass, control is returned to the caller.
   - ❌ If validation fails:
     - Raise `ValidationError` with structured diagnostics  
     - Provide exact mismatch detail (missing method, wrong version, etc.)  
     - Halt execution unless soft mode is enabled

🔍 Modular Validation Subsystems
---------------------------------

ImportSpy’s engine is composed of distinct layers, each with its own responsibility:

🔹 **Import Interceptor**  
   Detects runtime context at the moment of import. Gathers caller identity and call stack.

🔹 **SpyModel Generator**  
   Constructs a normalized model from dynamic runtime inputs. Represents the environment as data.

🔹 **Validator Stack**  
   Runs a pipeline of validators, including:
   - Structural validators (classes, functions, attributes)
   - Environmental validators (OS, Python, architecture)
   - Context validators (importer identity, variables, contract location)

🔹 **Report Engine**  
   Formats failure messages and traces:
   - Uses centralized error codes
   - Offers developer-facing hints and CI-friendly logs

🔹 **Resolution Manager** (Planned)  
   In future releases, this will support:
   - Auto-suggestions for mismatches  
   - Soft warnings for dry runs  
   - Contract diffing and explainability tools

⚙️ Optimizing for Runtime Performance
--------------------------------------

Validation must be precise — but also fast. ImportSpy uses:

- **Lazy Evaluation** – modules are only analyzed when accessed.  
- **Context Caching** – avoids recomputing runtime metadata.  
- **Selective Enforcement** – skips system libraries and only enforces contracts for targeted modules.  
- **Failure Short-Circuiting** – stops on the first critical violation unless configured otherwise.

In most use cases, validation completes in under 50ms — fast enough for production use, even inside plugin systems.

🔐 Why This Matters
--------------------

Python offers no guardrails by default. Anyone can import anything, in any context.

ImportSpy's validation engine creates those guardrails by:

✅ Binding module behavior to structural truth  
✅ Locking execution to trusted environments  
✅ Giving developers and systems **predictable, explainable outcomes**

It’s the difference between _hoping your module runs correctly_ and _knowing that it only ever runs under the right conditions._
