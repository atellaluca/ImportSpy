Runtime Analysis in ImportSpy
=============================

ImportSpy‚Äôs runtime analysis engine ensures that a module is imported and executed  
**only in a compliant, verified environment**. Rather than validating the imported module itself,  
ImportSpy focuses on validating the **importing context**‚Äîthe environment that attempts to load the module‚Äî  
against a predefined **import contract** (a SpyModel or external `.yml` contract).

This is achieved through **runtime reflection**, **environment inspection**,  
and **structured contract enforcement**, making ImportSpy a critical layer  
for controlled execution in dynamic Python applications.

Why Runtime Analysis Matters üî¨
-------------------------------

Unlike static validation tools, runtime analysis operates at the **moment of execution**.  
This allows ImportSpy to detect and prevent:

- **Inconsistent runtime behavior** due to OS/Python/interpreter mismatches.  
- **Silent failures** caused by missing environment variables or structural changes.  
- **Improper module usage** across deployments or by unauthorized code.

Runtime analysis is essential in:

- **Plugin architectures** where modules are dynamically discovered and loaded.  
- **CI/CD pipelines** where execution context differs from local development.  
- **Containerized or multi-architecture environments** with varied runtimes.

Key Stages of Runtime Validation ‚öôÔ∏è
------------------------------------

ImportSpy performs validation through the following structured steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Import Interception**  
   - Hooks into Python‚Äôs import stack to **trace the source of the import call**.  
   - Identifies the **calling module** and its execution environment.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Execution Context Extraction**  
   - Dynamically retrieves:  
     - **OS & architecture** (e.g. Linux, x86_64)  
     - **Python version & interpreter** (e.g. 3.12.4 CPython)  
     - **Environment variables**  
     - **System-level runtime characteristics**  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Import Contract Enforcement**  
   - Compares the actual environment against a declared **SpyModel** or YAML-based contract.  
   - Validates that all declared constraints (e.g., required variables, version compatibility, architecture) are satisfied.  

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Validation Outcome**  
   - ‚úÖ If compliant ‚Üí the import proceeds.  
   - ‚ùå If mismatched ‚Üí ImportSpy raises a `ValueError`, blocking execution.  

5Ô∏è‚É£ **Structured Logging & Feedback**  
   - Errors are logged with detailed diagnostics.  
   - Developers receive **clear messages** indicating **what failed and why**.  

Introspection and Reflection in Action ü™û
-----------------------------------------

ImportSpy leverages Python's dynamic inspection tools to extract execution metadata:

üîç **Stack Inspection**  
- `inspect.stack()` ‚Üí Identifies the importing module.  
- `inspect.getmodule()` ‚Üí Resolves context for validation.  

üîç **System Identification**  
- `platform.system()`, `platform.machine()` ‚Üí Ensures OS and architecture match.  
- `platform.python_version()`, `sys.version_info` ‚Üí Validates interpreter compatibility.  

üîç **Environment Configuration**  
- `os.environ` ‚Üí Fetches runtime environment variables for validation.  

These techniques allow ImportSpy to **construct a SpyModel representation** of the importing context,  
which is then validated against the import contract.

How Runtime Analysis Powers ImportSpy üöÄ
----------------------------------------

Runtime analysis is the foundation of ImportSpy‚Äôs compliance engine, enabling:

‚úÖ **Import-time contract validation**  
‚úÖ **Execution boundary enforcement**  
‚úÖ **Detection of structural and environmental mismatches**  
‚úÖ **Cross-environment consistency** across Python versions, OSes, and architectures  

In plugin systems, this means untrusted code cannot load modules unless the execution context is compliant.  
In pipelines, it ensures deployments are executed in the intended environment.

Performance Optimizations ‚ö°
----------------------------

Runtime validation, if not optimized, can slow down import performance.  
ImportSpy introduces several mechanisms to **minimize runtime overhead**:

- **Lazy Evaluation** ‚Üí Contract checks only occur when needed.  
- **Context Caching** ‚Üí Repeated validations reuse previously computed state.  
- **Scope Targeting** ‚Üí Only external imports are evaluated, skipping system/internal code.  

These features allow ImportSpy to offer **strict enforcement** with **minimal cost**.

Final Considerations üèÜ
------------------------

ImportSpy‚Äôs runtime engine is more than a validation tool‚Äîit‚Äôs a **gatekeeper** for execution boundaries.  
By dynamically inspecting the importing context and enforcing declared constraints, it ensures:

- ‚úÖ **Compliance across all environments**  
- ‚úÖ **Predictable, secure execution**  
- ‚úÖ **Control over where and how your code is run**  

Runtime analysis transforms Python‚Äôs flexibility into **enforceable safety guarantees**,  
making ImportSpy an essential part of **modern, scalable Python ecosystems**.
