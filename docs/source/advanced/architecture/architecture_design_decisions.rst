Design Decisions Behind ImportSpy
=================================

ImportSpy is designed to **validate and enforce execution constraints at runtime**,  
ensuring that a module is only imported in a **compliant environment**.  
Rather than validating the structure of a module itself, ImportSpy focuses on **where and how it is imported**,  
and whether the **importing environment matches the declared requirements** specified in an import contract.

This document provides an **in-depth overview of the design choices** that shaped ImportSpy,  
explaining why each strategy was chosen to balance **security, performance, and flexibility**  
in complex, modular Python ecosystems.

Why Runtime Validation Instead of Static Analysis? ‚ö°
-----------------------------------------------------

While tools like `mypy` and `pylint` catch issues **before execution**,  
they cannot address **runtime-specific conditions** such as:

- Modules imported dynamically (e.g., plugins).
- Runtime-determined dependencies or interpreters.
- Environment-variable-driven execution logic.

**Design Rationale:**  
ImportSpy focuses on **runtime validation** to ensure imports occur only  
under the correct execution conditions‚Äî**when and where the module is actually imported**.  
This provides dynamic protection that **static analysis cannot guarantee**.

Why Hook Into Python‚Äôs Import System? üö™
----------------------------------------

Python‚Äôs flexible import system is a **double-edged sword**.  
It supports lazy and dynamic imports, but also allows code to be executed  
**in unintended or unsafe contexts**.

**Design Rationale:**  
ImportSpy **hooks into the import stack** to:

- Trace **who is importing the protected module**.
- Block execution if the importing environment **violates contract rules**.
- Detect **contextual mismatches** that static analysis would miss.

This interception enables precise validation at the **point of interaction**.

Why Use Introspection for Environment Validation? üîç
----------------------------------------------------

Python is **dynamic by nature**, which means runtime characteristics often differ  
across systems and deployments.

**Design Rationale:**  
ImportSpy uses **Python‚Äôs introspection and reflection** to:

- Extract execution context (OS, architecture, interpreter, env variables).
- Detect real-time execution anomalies.
- Build a runtime model (`SpyModel`) of the environment for validation.

This allows ImportSpy to **enforce contextual rules dynamically**.

Why Introduce Import Contracts (SpyModel)? üõ°Ô∏è
---------------------------------------------

Hardcoding validation logic in code would be inflexible and difficult to maintain.

**Design Rationale:**  
ImportSpy introduces the `SpyModel`, a **declarative execution contract**  
that describes how and where a module can be used. It:

- Allows modules to express expectations as **data, not logic**.
- Makes validation **portable, maintainable, and testable**.
- Serves as the foundation for **external contracts in YAML**.

This abstraction supports **both embedded and external validation modes**.

Why Validate the Runtime Environment? üèóÔ∏è
----------------------------------------

Python modules often break when moved across:

- OSes (Windows/Linux/Mac)
- CPU architectures (x86_64, ARM)
- Python versions (e.g., 3.9 vs. 3.12)
- Interpreters (CPython, PyPy)

**Design Rationale:**  
ImportSpy enforces:

- **OS and architecture matching**
- **Python version compliance**
- **Interpreter validation**
- **Presence and correctness of required environment variables**

This ensures modules only run in **safe, verified conditions**.

Why Optimize for Runtime Performance? ‚öôÔ∏è
----------------------------------------

Runtime tools risk introducing latency or overhead.

**Design Rationale:**  
ImportSpy includes:

- **Validation caching** for repeated imports
- **Lazy context extraction**
- **Minimal interference with module load time**

This enables **strict compliance** without degrading user experience.

Why Provide Detailed Validation Errors? üìù
---------------------------------------------

Generic error messages frustrate developers.

**Design Rationale:**  
ImportSpy returns:

- **Specific exception types** per validation error
- **Context-aware feedback** (e.g., missing env var, OS mismatch)
- **Configurable behavior** (warnings vs hard failures)

This makes debugging **faster and more transparent**.

Final Design Principles üîö
--------------------------

ImportSpy‚Äôs design is shaped by the following principles:

- **Zero-Trust Imports** ‚Üí Non-compliant modules are blocked immediately.
- **Context-First Validation** ‚Üí Only the environment of the **importer** is analyzed.
- **Declarative by Default** ‚Üí Validation rules live in **contracts, not code**.
- **Scalable to Large Systems** ‚Üí Works across microservices, plugins, and CI/CD.
