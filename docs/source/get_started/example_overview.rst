Example Overview: Plugin-Based Architecture
===========================================

This section provides an in-depth look at a **Plugin-Based Architecture** example using **ImportSpy**.  
It demonstrates how to enforce **structural and runtime compliance** for dynamically loaded plugins.

Why This Example Matters 🚀
---------------------------

In modern applications, **plugins, extensions, and dynamically loaded modules** introduce flexibility  
but also potential instability. Ensuring that each plugin conforms to expected structures **prevents failures**,  
**improves maintainability**, and **enhances security**.

This example is particularly useful for:

- **Modular Systems 🔌** – Ensuring dynamically loaded plugins follow expected structures.  
- **Microservices 🌐** – Validating dependencies and runtime constraints across distributed components.  
- **Extensible Applications 📦** – Providing safety mechanisms when integrating third-party modules.  

By using **ImportSpy**, we ensure that **only valid, well-structured plugins** interact with the core system,  
eliminating unexpected behavior caused by unvalidated extensions.

How It Works 🔍
---------------

The **Plugin-Based Architecture** example consists of **three main components**:

1. **Plugin Interface (`plugin_interface.py`)** – Defines a **base class** that all plugins must extend.
2. **Spy Model (`package.py`)** – Specifies **validation rules** using ImportSpy.
3. **Plugin Implementation (`extension.py`)** – Implements a **plugin** that adheres to the expected structure.

Each of these components plays a crucial role in ensuring that dynamically loaded plugins are **structurally valid**  
and **functionally safe** before execution.

Code Breakdown 📜
=================

Below, you will find the complete source code for each file used in this example.  
Each file serves a distinct role in enforcing **plugin compliance**.

Plugin Interface (`plugin_interface.py`) 🏗️
-------------------------------------------

Defines a **base class** that all plugins must inherit to ensure they follow a standardized structure.

Spy Model (`package.py`) 🛡️
----------------------------

Defines **the validation rules** for plugins using **ImportSpy**.  
This ensures that only properly structured plugins are allowed.

.. literalinclude:: ../../../examples/plugin_based_architecture/package.py
   :language: python

Plugin Implementation (`extension.py`) 🔌
-----------------------------------------

Implements a **plugin** that follows the validation rules defined in `package.py`.

Next Steps 🎯
=============

Now that you understand the core structure, it's time to **test ImportSpy in action!**

- **Run the example** following the guide in :doc:`run_example`.  
- **Explore how validation works** in :doc:`../overview/understanding_importspy/validation_and_compliance`.  
- **Modify the plugin** in :doc:`example_overview` and test ImportSpy's validation mechanism.  

By experimenting with these files, you’ll see **firsthand how ImportSpy enforces compliance**  
and ensures that dynamically loaded plugins interact with your system **safely and predictably**. 🚀
