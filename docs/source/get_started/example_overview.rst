ImportSpy Examples: Real-World Scenarios in Action üöÄ
=====================================================

Welcome to the **Examples** section of ImportSpy ‚Äî where theory meets practice.

In this space, you'll explore **runnable, real-world demonstrations** showing how ImportSpy helps enforce **structural validation**, **interface consistency**, and **runtime compliance** in modular Python systems.

Whether you're working with plugins, pipelines, APIs, or layered architectures, these examples provide **blueprints you can adapt** to your own projects.

Why Examples Matter üß©
-----------------------

Modern Python applications are highly dynamic.  
But that flexibility comes with risks: unexpected behaviors, silent failures, and integration mismatches.

ImportSpy gives you a way to bring **formal guarantees** into the dynamic world of imports.  
Here, you'll see exactly how it works ‚Äî with practical, minimal, and extensible examples.

How to Use These Examples ‚öôÔ∏è
------------------------------

Each example in this section is:

- ‚úÖ Self-contained and ready to run  
- ‚úÖ Designed around real architectural patterns  
- ‚úÖ Focused on one validation principle at a time  
- ‚úÖ Ideal for experimentation and adaptation

To try them:

1. Ensure you have **ImportSpy installed**  
   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install importspy

2. Choose an example that matches your context  
3. Run it locally  
4. Modify the contract or the code and observe the validation outcomes  
5. Learn how ImportSpy blocks invalid imports and reinforces structural safety

Available Example üí°
---------------------

The first complete walkthrough is:

üì¶ :doc:`examples/plugin_based_architecture/index`

This scenario demonstrates:

- Defining import contracts
- Handling plugin structure enforcement
- Using both **embedded** and **CLI** validation modes
- Running validation in a pipeline context

Coming Soon ‚ú®
--------------

We're actively expanding this section with more examples, including:

- API structure validation (FastAPI, Flask)
- Cross-service contract enforcement in microservices
- Schema enforcement in data pipelines
- Security policies for runtime imports
