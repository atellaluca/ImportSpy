Installation Guide
==================

Welcome to the **Installation Guide** for ImportSpy.  
This section will walk you through setting up ImportSpy in your environment ‚Äî quickly, cleanly, and with confidence.

ImportSpy is designed to be lightweight and easy to integrate into any Python project that values **runtime validation**, **structural compliance**, and **predictable imports**.

System Requirements üìå
-----------------------

Before you begin, make sure your development environment meets the following requirements:

- **Python 3.10 or later**  
  ImportSpy relies on modern Python features and guarantees compatibility only from version 3.10 onward.

- **pip (latest version)**  
  To ensure smooth installation and dependency resolution.

- **Virtual Environment (Recommended)**  
  While optional, using a virtual environment is best practice for avoiding dependency conflicts and ensuring isolation.

Installing ImportSpy ‚öôÔ∏è
------------------------

1. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   While not mandatory, we strongly recommend installing ImportSpy in a virtual environment:

   .. tabs::

      .. tab:: macOS / Linux

         .. code-block:: bash

            python3 -m venv venv
            source venv/bin/activate

      .. tab:: Windows

         .. code-block:: bash

            python -m venv venv
            .\venv\Scripts\activate

   Once activated, your terminal should indicate that the environment is active.

2. **Install ImportSpy with pip**

   Now install ImportSpy directly from PyPI:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install importspy

   This command will install the latest stable version of ImportSpy and all required dependencies.

Verifying the Installation ‚úÖ
------------------------------

To confirm that ImportSpy is correctly installed and ready to use, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   importspy --version

If everything is set up correctly, the terminal will display the current version of ImportSpy.

Troubleshooting Tips üßØ
------------------------

If something goes wrong:

- Ensure you're using **Python 3.10+**
- Activate your virtual environment before running `pip install`
- If needed, upgrade pip:  
  .. code-block:: bash  
     python -m pip install --upgrade pip

You're Ready to Go üéâ
