The `Spy` class is the core of the **ImportSpy** package. It dynamically inspects and validates importing modules to ensure they meet the rules defined by the developer. This allows developers to take a **proactive approach** in managing how their code is used by external modules, enforcing structure, and catching potential issues early.
